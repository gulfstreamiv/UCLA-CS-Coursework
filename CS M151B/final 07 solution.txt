1) 

problem: Too many capacity misses in the data cache
solution: Increase size of cache
drawback: larger latency, power

problem: Too many control hazards
solution: dynamic branch prediction
drawback: more power consumption

problem: Our carry lookahead adder is too slow
solution: use ,adder, piplining
drawback: increase complexity

problem: We want to be able to use a larger immediate field in the MIPS ISA
solution: decrease registers, increase instruction size , decrease OP code
drawback: resource spilling, complexity of coding will grow, decrease instruction

problem: The execution time of our CPU with a signle-cycle datapath is too high
solution: multicycle, pipelining 
drawback: complexity (more hardware such as more latches), increase CPI
